Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Dan. Iâ€™m a human from Ottawa who loves to learn and to teach. At the moment, I make a living building iOS apps. 

In my 9-to-5, I've spent my career in all sorts of situations â€” freelancing, tiny startups, small-but-growing companies, and Big Tech Co's. I've spent plenty of time in both Independent Contributor and Engineering Management roles, both of which scratch very different itches in my brain, and both of which I hope to keep exploring and getting better at over time. In all cases, my roles have been centered primarily around native iOS development â€” I am still unabashedly in love with Apple's dev ecosystem, and 10 years in, this space continues to surprise, challenge, and excite me. 

In my spare time, I use independent app development as a creative outlet, pushing my limits as both a developer and a designer, in fits and bursts â€” admittedly, I often struggle to get around the fact that there are only 24 hours in a day, and those hours tend to be spent on more important things. I also love to write, which is ostensibly what this website is for, although I've not managed to squeeze writing into my 24-hour chunks in quite some time. Back at it again soon, I hope.

I love what I do, but I also try **very** hard not to take myself too seriously. Come say hi and have a laugh with me [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/danielmgauthier)!
