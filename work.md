#### July 2019 - Present
### Independent iOS Developer
This summer, I was feeling restless and in need of a bit of a shakeup. I decided to leave my job after 3 and a half years, catch my breath, and see if I could make a go of things on my own for a little while. I'm currently working on a few interesting contracts, and spending a bit more time than usual on learning and on some small personal projects. I'm planning to keep this going for the foreseeable future, but I'm always open to hearing about new contract or employment opportunities.

#### January 2018 - July 2019
### iOS Team Lead, SHOEBOX Inc.
I led a team of 8 other iOS developers, working across multiple product teams, providing guidance and mentorship. I made decisions around the design, architecture and implementation of new features, led the development of core pieces of functionality in our apps, and built tools and processes to make sure my teammates were happy, motivated, and doing the best work they can do.

#### January 2016 - January 2018
### Senior iOS Developer, SHOEBOX Inc.
I played an important role in a growing team of iOS developers, planning and building new features in several apps while striving to address some deep technical debt that had begun to accumulate. These apps included Modica, a media capturing and sharing app for doctors; Shoebox, a clinically validated audiometer; and QuickTest, a simple hearing screening tool.

#### April 2015 - November 2015
### Lead iOS Developer, Volley Industries
I was brought onto a small team at Volley to lead the development of a native iOS app to complement Volley’s web app. The app allowed users with expertise in various topics to ask for advice, discuss solutions to problems and make meaningful connections with one another. Collaborating closely with a designer and a backend developer, we launched a beautiful, fully-featured app in five months.

Unfortunately not many traces of Volley left on the internet, but here's a tiny peek at the kind of stuff we were working on: [tweet by David Hariri](https://twitter.com/davehariri/status/1184264467430948864?s=20)

#### September 2013 - February 2015
### Lead iOS Developer, Arroware Industries
As the first iOS developer at this small startup, I led the design and development of two iOS apps — My Apollo, a social networking app (photo sharing, status updates, etc.) and LockTalk, an instant messaging app — both built on top of a custom, peer-to-peer cloud infrastructure.

#### May 2012 - September 2013
### Independent iOS Developer
After graduating, I committed myself fully to improving my mobile development and design skills, and to learning how to create usable, useful products from start to finish. I shipped two apps to the App Store (sadly, no longer maintained or available): SixthNote, a journal app with a focus on connecting memories to music; and Switchboard, a strategic two-player word game.
