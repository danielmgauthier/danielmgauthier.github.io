This week, I‚Äôm doing a set of 3 short articles that explore some more advanced, concrete ideas around custom transitions. I give some additional context in the first one, so you may want to take a gander if you haven‚Äôt already:

**[Mastering view controller transitions, part 1: make them reusable](https://danielgauthier.me/2020/02/24/vctransitions1.html)**  
**[Mastering view controller transitions, part 2: make them feel natural](https://danielgauthier.me/2020/02/27/vctransitions2.html)**

As a quick refresher, here‚Äôs an example of the transitions we introduced in the first article, and that all this writing is based on:

    <video controls muted>
      <source src="/assets/img/game-demo.mov" type="video/mp4">
    Your browser does not support the video tag.
    </video>
</p>

Okay, you‚Äôre up to speed! Let‚Äôs dive into the third and final goal.

## Goal 3: I want my presented view controller to be able to easily define and adjust its own size
As I‚Äôve mentioned in the past couple articles, it was really important to me in building these transitions that they were easy to reuse in different contexts. That means that if I‚Äôm building a simple presentation that slides in from the bottom, I certainly don‚Äôt want every view controller that uses it to be locked to one specific size ‚Äî the size should depend on the content! ‚Äî and I also don‚Äôt want to have to think too hard about setting the size appropriately every time I use my custom transition with a new view controller. 

On top of that, I also quickly realized that it was important for me to be able to change the size of my view controllers while they were presented ‚Äî as the content inside a presented view controller changed based on user input, I wanted the view controller to be able to grow or shrink to accommodate the content updates. (You can see this happening as tags and notes are added to the ‚ÄúAdd game‚Äù view in the video above.)

Ultimately, we can accomplish all this (and more!) with the help of Auto Layout, a simple custom presentation controller, and the `CustomPresentable` protocol we‚Äôve been using in the past two articles. 

The first thing we‚Äôll need to make sure of is this: our presented view needs to have its constraints set up such that they fully define the presented view‚Äôs height. In other words, there needs to be an unbroken chain of constraints and subviews stretching from the top edge to the bottom edge of the presented view. 

To make sure that point is clear, let‚Äôs start by looking at a somewhat contrived example. Imagine we‚Äôre just trying to present a view that contains a big rectangle with a smaller button underneath. One way we might set up constraints is like this:

![Missing bottom constraint](/assets/img/indie-5-3-1.png)
{:.screenshot}

This is a valid set of constraints ‚Äî if you installed these in a full-screen view, you‚Äôd get a rectangle and button at the top of the view as expected. But, these constraints don‚Äôt explicitly define the height of their superview, because there‚Äôs no bottom constraint; there could be any amount of space between the bottom of the button and the bottom of its superview, and these constraints would be satisfied.

Similarly, this is another valid set of constraints:

![Missing height constraint](/assets/img/indie-5-3-2.png)
{:.screenshot}

If you installed these in a full-screen view, the rectangle would fill most of the screen, with the button sitting at the bottom. But these constraints don‚Äôt explicitly define the height of their superview either, because the rectangle view has no height constraint; these constraints could be satisfied in a superview of any height, because the height of the rectangle will simply adjust accordingly.

What we need is this:

![All necessary constraints are set](/assets/img/indie-5-3-3.png)
{:.screenshot}

In this situation, the constraints will only be satisfied if the superview is exactly 198 points tall: 100 for the rectangle, 50 for the button, and 16x3 for the top, bottom and in-between spaces. Of course, if we tried to install these constraints in a full-screen view, the constraints would break, since an iPhone screen isn‚Äôt 198 points tall. But this is actually exactly what we want: our constraints now define exactly what the height of their superview should be, and we‚Äôll be able to use that fact to ensure that our presented view is sized correctly.

Next, we‚Äôll set up our custom presentation controller. The presentation controller is responsible for defining what the frame of the presented view should actually be. It‚Äôll do this by defining a constant width that all presented views should have, and then using that to calculate what the presented view‚Äôs height should be, based on its content and constraints.

Luckily, UIKit makes it pretty easy to do this. We‚Äôll need to override a function and a variable in our custom presentation controller to get this to work:

```swift
override func containerViewWillLayoutSubviews() {
  presentedView?.frame = frameOfPresentedViewInContainerView
}

override var frameOfPresentedViewInContainerView: CGRect {
  guard let containerView = containerView, let presentedView = presentedView else { return .zero }

  let inset: CGFloat = 16
  let safeAreaFrame = containerView.bounds.inset(by: containerView.safeAreaInsets)

  let targetWidth = safeAreaFrame.width - 2 * inset
  let fittingSize = CGSize(
    width: targetWidth,
    height: UIView.layoutFittingCompressedSize.height
  )
  
  let targetHeight = presentedView.systemLayoutSizeFitting(
    fittingSize, 
    withHorizontalFittingPriority: .required, 
    verticalFittingPriority: .defaultLow
  ).height

  var frame = safeAreaFrame
  frame.origin.x += inset
  frame.origin.y += 8.0
  frame.size.width = targetWidth
  frame.size.height = targetHeight
  
  return frame
}
```

Note: credit for the code above goes to [Kyle Bashour](https://twitter.com/kylebshr), whose [excellent article](https://kylebashour.com/posts/custom-view-controller-presentation-tips) helped me figure this out üôè    
{:.notes}

In `frameOfPresentedViewInContainerView`, we first figure out what the width of the presented view should be, based on our desire to have it inset 16 points from either side of the screen. The next part ‚Äî setting a `fittingSize` and then calling `systemLayoutSizeFitting` ‚Äî essentially amounts to us asking UIKit the following: given our target width, what‚Äôs the smallest height that the presented view could have that satisfies all its internal constraints? (In our rectangle and button example above, we‚Äôd get 198 as our `targetHeight`.) We then position the frame where we want it to be, give it the size we calculated, and return it. 

When our presentation kicks off and the container view is about to layout its subviews, `containerViewWillLayoutSubviews` gets called. This gives us the chance to use `frameOfPresentedViewInContainerView` to assign a frame with the correct width and height to our presented view before it gets presented. When all is said and done, we get something like this:

<p class="screenshot">
    <video controls muted>
      <source src="/assets/img/indie-5-3-eg1.mov" type="video/mp4">
    Your browser does not support the video tag.
    </video>
</p>

Just like that, we now have the ability to present a view controller of any size, as long as that view controller‚Äôs view defines its own height with constraints. However, we‚Äôre still missing a big piece of the puzzle: this doesn‚Äôt currently account for any changes in the presented view controller‚Äôs content _after_ it‚Äôs been presented. A change in the layout of our presented view doesn‚Äôt automatically trigger `containerViewWillLayoutSubviews`, which means we don‚Äôt have a chance to re-calculate and re-assign `frameOfPresentedViewInContainerView`. No big deal; we‚Äôll just have to trigger it ourselves.

One approach we can take to make this kind of dynamic layout update simple and reusable is to add this functionality to our `CustomPresentable` protocol ‚Äî a protocol that our presented view controllers are already required to conform to. Let‚Äôs update `CustomPresentable` to look something like this:

```swift
protocol CustomPresentable: UIViewController {
  var transitionManager: UIViewControllerTransitioningDelegate? { get set }
  var dismissalHandlingScrollView: UIScrollView? { get }
  func updatePresentationLayout(animated: Bool)
}

extension CustomPresentable {
  var dismissalHandlingScrollView: UIScrollView? { nil }
	
  func updatePresentationLayout(animated: Bool = false) {
    presentationController?.containerView?.setNeedsLayout()
    if animated {
      UIView.animate(withDuration: 0.3, delay: 0.0, usingSpringWithDamping: 1.0, initialSpringVelocity: 0.0, options: .allowUserInteraction, animations: {
        self.presentationController?.containerView?.layoutIfNeeded()
      }, completion: nil)
    } else {
      presentationController?.containerView?.layoutIfNeeded()
    }
  }
}
``` 

Here, we‚Äôve used the new Swift 5 feature that allows protocols to ‚Äúinherit‚Äù from classes ‚Äî enforcing that any class that conforms to `CustomPresentable` is a view controller. This then allows us to provide a default implementation for our new function, `updatePresentationLayout(animated:)`, via protocol extension. This function simply marks our presentation controller‚Äôs container view as needing a layout update, and then performs the layout update, animating it if requested.

Now, whenever something happens in our presented view controller‚Äôs layout that requires a size change, we can call `updatePresentationLayout(animated:)` to update the presented view's frame. In the case of our simple rectangle example, we can respond to the button tap like this:

```swift
@objc private func changeSizeButtonTapped() {
  rectangleHeightConstraint.constant = CGFloat(Int.random(in: 50...400))
  updatePresentationLayout(animated: true)
}
```

Here, we simply change the height of the rectangle to a random value, and then call `updatePresentationLayout(animated: true)` to perform the update. Here‚Äôs what that looks like:

<p class="screenshot">
    <video controls muted>
      <source src="/assets/img/indie-5-3-eg2.mov" type="video/mp4">
    Your browser does not support the video tag.
    </video>
</p>

This is a simple example, but the exact same principles are applied in the more complex transitions shown in the video at the top. For example, when the ‚ÄúNotes‚Äù button is tapped to reveal the text input view, that text input view‚Äôs `isHidden` property is set to false; since it‚Äôs arranged inside a stack view, the stack view automatically reveals the view and adjusts its own intrinsic size; and then I simply call `updatePresentationLayout(animated: true)` to give my presentation controller a chance to resize the presented view based on these internal changes.

Note: Sometimes, the Auto Layout engine tries to update the layout of your presented view *before* the view's frame has a chance to update, which will cause constraint conflicts if the views and constraints in your presented view no longer fit properly inside the old frame. A simple way to deal with this is to lower the priority of your bottom-most constraint to 999, which gives Auto Layout a bit of flexibility to properly sort things out when your layout is changing.

### Wrap-up

Once you wrap your head around what the role of a custom presentation controller should be, there are a whole bunch of interesting things you can start do with it. In my custom transitions, my presentation controller is responsible for detecting the appearance of the keyboard, and adjusting the positioning of the presented view based on the keyboard‚Äôs frame. It communicates with the presented view controller (via `CustomPresentable`) to ensure that the current first responder is always visible between the top of the screen and the top of the keyboard. It also uses `CustomPresentable` to hide the status bar whenever the presented view is shifted beyond the top of the screen. You can see all this in action in the video at the top, as I start adding notes to my ‚ÄúUndertale‚Äù entry. 

I'd love to share some of those implementation details another day; regardless, my hope at this point is that, having read this little series on custom view controller transitions, you now have all the tools you need to get creative and build your own fun, reusable, well-polished view controller transitions. It's a tricky little API, but if you put a bit of effort into understanding it up front, it really does open up possibilities that otherwise might have felt overwhelmingly difficult or tedious to build. 

So...go build something awesome! ü¶∏
